##Getting Started with D3!

First, take a deep breath. D3 is easy and fun!

D3, or Data Driven Documents, is a Javascript library that allows you to dynamically create DOM elements based on data. 

You need to know and understand HTML, CSS and basic Javascript.

Much like JQuery you link D3 in your index.html either by downloading and including that file in your files and linking or by linking to the CDN for the latest release:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
```
