Quick start guide

Each group needs to create a getting started tutorial on their topic. It should be:

Written in markdown and on a Github Repo
You should include screen shots, gifs, diagrams, or other tools that will help make the guide as useful as possible (but don't waste time on styling, this project is about content, not style).
You should look to the offical docs/start guides for inspiration, but make yours more approachable for WDI students. Think about what assumed knowledge is in the offical docs, and unassume it. Fill in the missing pieces.
Make sure to note dependencies, and similarities/differences to other types of tech we've studied.
Any code files that are needed should be included in this repo. This includes Gemfiles or package.json!



Setting Up Your D3.js Project

1. If you use npm, npm install d3. Otherwise, download the latest release. The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from d3js.org, CDNJS, or unpkg. For example:

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>
