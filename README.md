##Getting Started with D3!

First, take a deep breath. D3 is easy and fun!

D3, or Data Driven Documents, is a Javascript library that allows you to dynamically create DOM elements based on data. 

You need to know and understand HTML, CSS and basic Javascript. It's also helpful to know about SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics. Which we'll talk about below.

Much like JQuery you link D3 in your the head of your index.html either by downloading and including that file in your Javascript folder and linking or by linking to the CDN for the latest release:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
```

You can write your D3 code directly in your HTML files if you wish, just between ```html <script> </script> 
``` 
tags or separately in your script.js or other javascript files.  

## What is SVG?

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
